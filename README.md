# Introduction

This is a template for getting started with iOS development using GitHub and fastlane.

# Getting started

You'll need a working MacOS development environment with XCode 10 to use this
template. You can find instructions to get up and running on the Apple [XCode website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

## What's contained in this project

This template contains a simple Food Tracker App based off of the [Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift) Lessons](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html). Where necessary the template has been upgraded to use Swift 4. The app displays a list of meals consisting of a name, rating, and photo. Users are able to add or edit a meal by navigating to a detail screen. The app also includes a lightweight solution for basic data persistence.
